# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle where the Project team gathers, analysis and defines the functional and non-functional
requirements that the software should meet. With this, stakeholders and the development team are on the same page and know exactly what the outcome should look like.
It also prevents scope creep by clearly defining the scope of the project.
