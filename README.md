# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle where the Project team gathers, analysis and defines the functional and non-functional
requirements that the software should meet. With this, stakeholders and the development team are on the same page and know exactly what the outcome should look like.
It also prevents scope creep by clearly defining the scope of the project.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the desired requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Gathering: This includes organizing workshops with stakeholders to gather requirements, distributing surveys for feedback from larger audience,
  conducting interviews with stakeholders to get their needs and expectations.

- Requirement Elicitation: brainstorming sessions to create new requirements, focus group sessions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements,
  prototyping for stakeholders to visualize the product's look and performance.
  
- Requirement Documentation: creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non functional requirements, documenting user stories to view product from user's
  perspective.
  
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling: priortizing requirements based on their importance, analysing the feasibility of requirements in terms of cost and technical
  constraint.
  
- Requirement Validation: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness, drafting clear acceptance criteria.
